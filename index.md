# About us

I am a tenure-track Associate Professor at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/facultydetails/zzjs/chengyuan), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my Ph.D. from [SJTU](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/) in 2021 and B.Eng. from [UESTC](https://www.ese.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2016. From Mar 2022 to Mar 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Sigma Lab, [THU](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (Advisor: [Prof. Lu Fang](https://www.luvision.net/)). From Dec 2020 to Oct 2021, I was a researcher at Alibaba [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/). From May 2019 to Nov 2020, I was a visiting scholar at [HKU](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) (Hosts: [Prof. Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/)).

Our Computing Technology Laboratory ([CLab](/people/)) is a multidisciplinary research group positioned at the intersection of **computational methodologies** and **artificial intelligence**. We are dedicated to advancing the frontiers of AI applications, including computer vision, large models, embodied intelligence, and more. Our research is characterized by the co-design of large-scale algorithms, reconfigurable architectures, edge intelligence systems, and neuromorphic sensors. By synergizing hardware-software and opto-electronic integration, we aim to deliver scalable, versatile, and energy-efficient solutions to empower the next-generation everything-intelligent AI era.

We are looking for talented phd/master students, research assistants, interns, and postdocs ([招生贴](/position/)). If you are interested in working with us, feel free to contact [email](mailto:cyuan328@sjtu.edu.cn).
