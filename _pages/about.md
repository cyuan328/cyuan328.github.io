I am a tenure-track Associate Professor at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my Ph.D. from [SJTU](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/) in 2021 and B.Eng. from [UESTC](https://www.ese.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2016. From Mar 2022 to Mar 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Sigma Lab, [THU](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (Advisor: [Prof. Lu Fang](https://www.luvision.net/)). From Dec 2020 to Oct 2021, I was a researcher at Computing Technology Lab, Alibaba [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/). From May 2019 to Nov 2020, I was a visiting scholar at [HKU](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) (Hosts: [Dr. Ngai Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/)). 

I am looking for talented PhD/Master students, PostDocs, research assistants, and interns ([more details](/position/)). If you are interested in working with us, feel free to contact [email](mailto:cyuan328@gmail.com).


## Research interests

My research focuses on the intersection of __artificial intelligence__ and __computational optics__, __terminal computing__, and __algorithm-hardware co-design__, particularly the following areas:

- <font size="3">Large-scale photonic computing including free-space optical system and on-chip optics</font>
- <font size="3">Structured edge computing architecture and terminal accelerator</font>
- <font size="3">Terminal computing for large model and embodied intelligence</font>
- <font size="3">Lightweight neural network design</font>
- <font size="3">Computational compression method</font>
