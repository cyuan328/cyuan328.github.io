I am a tenure-track Associate Professor at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my Ph.D. from [Department of Micro/Nano Electronics](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/) in 2021 and B.Eng. from [School of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ese.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2016. From Mar 2022 to Mar 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Sigma Lab, [Tsinghua University](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) (Advisor: [Prof. Lu](https://www.luvision.net/)). From Dec 2020 to Oct 2021, I was a researcher at Computing Technology Lab, Alibaba [DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/). From May 2019 to Nov 2020, I was a visiting scholar at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/) (Hosts: [Prof. Wong](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/)). 

Our Computing Technology Laboratory (CLab) is a multidisciplinary research group positioned at the intersection of computational methodologies and artificial intelligence. We are dedicated to advancing the frontiers of AI applications, including computer vision, large models, embodied intelligence, and more. Our research is characterized by the co-design of large-scale algorithms, reconfigurable architectures, edge intelligence systems, and neuromorphic sensors. By synergizing hardware-software and opto-electronic integration, we aim to deliver scalable, versatile, and energy-efficient solutions to empower the next-generation everything-intelligent AI era. 

We are looking for talented phd/master students, research assistants, interns, and postdocs ([招生贴](/position/)). If you are interested in working with us, feel free to contact [email](mailto:cyuan328@sjtu.edu.cn).
