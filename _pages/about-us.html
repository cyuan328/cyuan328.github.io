<h2>About us</h2>

<p>I am a tenure-track Associate Professor at the <a href="https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn/cn/facultydetails/zzjs/chengyuan">School of Artificial Intelligence</a>, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I received my Ph.D. from <a href="https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/">SJTU</a> in 2021 and B.Eng. from <a href="https://www.ese.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC</a> in 2016. From Mar 2022 to Mar 2025, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Sigma Lab, <a href="https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/">THU</a> (Advisor: <a href="https://www.luvision.net/">Prof. Lu Fang</a>). From Dec 2020 to Oct 2021, I was a researcher at Alibaba <a href="https://damo.alibaba.com/">DAMO Academy</a>. From May 2019 to Nov 2020, I was a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/">HKU</a> (Hosts: <a href="https://www.eee.hku.hk/~nwong/">Dr. Ngai Wong</a>).</p>

<p>Our Computing Technology Laboratory (<a href="/people/">CLab</a>) is a multidisciplinary research group positioned at the intersection of <strong>computational methodologies</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. We are dedicated to advancing the frontiers of AI applications, including computer vision, large models, embodied intelligence, and more. Our research is characterized by the co-design of large-scale algorithms, reconfigurable architectures, edge intelligence systems, and neuromorphic sensors. By synergizing hardware-software and opto-electronic integration, we aim to deliver scalable, versatile, and energy-efficient solutions to empower the next-generation everything-intelligent AI era.</p>

<p>We are looking for talented phd/master students, research assistants, interns, and postdocs (<a href="/position/">招生贴</a>). If you are interested in working with us, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:cyuan328@sjtu.edu.cn">email</a>.</p>
